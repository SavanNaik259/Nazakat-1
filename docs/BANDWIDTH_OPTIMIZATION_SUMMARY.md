# Simple Bandwidth Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong
- Website worked fine most of the time (used 12KB)
- But every 7-8 hours, first visitor had to download 17-18MB
- This happened because the cache "expired" and had to reload everything

## What I Fixed
Changed the cache settings so that:
- Instead of cache completely expiring after 7-8 hours
- The system now serves the old cached version instantly
- While quietly updating the cache in the background
- So users never wait for the big download again

## Technical Changes Made
1. **Changed cache headers** in `/netlify/functions/load-products.js`
2. **Extended client cache time** in product loader files
3. **Added background refresh** so updates happen behind the scenes

## Expected Result
- Before: Every 7-8 hours → 17-18MB download for first user
- After: Every 7-8 hours → 12KB (same as always) for all users

The main idea: Never make users wait for fresh data. Give them cached data instantly, update in background.
